# AutomatedHouse
When I was in Argentina in ORT high school, I had to do a final project for my Sophomore year. I did the code for an automated house that used solar panels to charge a battery. My teammates did the model of the house and the electronics involving it. 
##### The project is still not available, but it should be by around mid-March
