# AutomatedHouse
When I was in Argentina in ORT high school, I had to do a final project for my Sophomore year. I did the code for an automated house that used solar panels to charge a battery. My teammates did the model of the house and the electronics involving it. 

##### The project still has some bugs which I'm going to be fixing over the next couple of weeks.
